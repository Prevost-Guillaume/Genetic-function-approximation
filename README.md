# Genetic-function-approximation

The goal of this project is to find a way to approximate any function. 
The main difficulty is to find a general way to represent any formula, which can be optimized by genetic algorithm.
We have chosen to use binary trees for this purpose. 
The advantages of binary trees are that it is easy to manage the operational priority, as well as the implementation in genetic algorithm.
The nodes of a binary expression tree are the operations, and the leaves are the values.
